The arguments for function is kind of Array, so it can be 0,1 or more arguement for a function. 
  1: if you are using one argument does not existing then you will get undefined message.
  2: there is no overload concept as in Java as the argument is an array it without a signature for a function.
  3: the later function will overwrite privious one if their name are same.

String is a primitive data type in JavaScript not an object like in other language.
Number will present all kind of number type(integer, float, etc.)

Dynamic Properties
    An object with dynamic properties
    A primitive type can not have any properties.

Copying Value
  Primitive type:  when one primitive value is assigned from one variable to another. there will be new copied value for another variable.
                  and the two values in two variable are seperate.
                  

The arguments for functions are just local varialbe inside the function.

typeof  vs instanceof
  for any type of data: typeof returns the exact type and return functions if it is a function.
  for object type only: instanceof returns true or false.
